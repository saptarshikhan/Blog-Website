          <p class="card-text mb-auto my-2">
            the official number when it comes to its length is set at 5500 miles, its original length is estimated at a whopping 13,170 miles.
            It has been found that The Great Wall of China was not just built under one dynasty, but at least four different dynasties during the 7th and 8th century BC. This is to be expected as its construction lasted for at least 2500 years.
            The wall was commissioned by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang who wanted to protect China from outside forces.

              The Taj Mahal closely follows Islamic architecture melded with Persian and Indian design language. It is situated in Agra, India.

This effectively puts the Pyramid’s weight at 5.9 million tons.

              Situated in Lebanon, the Temple of Bacchus was built for the Wine God, however, there are still debates going on that piece of information as to whether it was built for the Wine-god or for the god of ecstasy. There is, however, no dispute on the fact that the Temple of Bacchus is one among the most architecturally magnificent structures in Baalbek.
